# How To Participate in Genesis Process

## Requirement

You must have follow this [guide](https://github.com/irisnet/irishub/blob/release0.10/docs/get-started/Install-the-Software.md) to install the correct version of **Iris**.

## Step 1: Create your own account


First you need to create a account as the corresponding validator operator for yourself if you don't have one
or you forgot its password.

```bash
iriscli keys add {account_name}
```
You can get the account information, including account address, public key address and mnemonic
```
NAME: TYPE: ADDRESS:            PUBKEY:

**Important** write this seed phrase in a safe place.
It is the only way to recover your account if you ever forget your password.

## Step 2: Initialize your node

Initialize the configuration files such as genesis.json and config.toml
```bash
iris init --home={path_to_your_home} --chain-id=fuxi-8000 --moniker=key-name
```

This command will create the corresponding files in the home directory.


## Step 3: Execute `gentx` command

```bash
iris gentx --name={operator_key_name} --home={path_to_your_home} --ip=node-ip
```
This commond will generate the transaction in the directoryï¼š{path_to_your_home}/config/gentx
Create the `CreateValidator` transaction and sign the transaction by the validator operator account you just created
The default commission data is:
*	delegation amount:           100iris
*	commission rate:             0.1
*	commission max rate:         0.2
*	commission max change rate:  0.01

> IP is your public IP, dont use internal IP

## Step 4: Sumbit your gentx.json

Submit your gentx-node-ID.json to `https://github.com/irisnet/testnets/tree/master/fuxi/fuxi-8000/config/gentx` by createing a pull request.

After the team has collected all the gen-tx transactions, we will publish the genesis file.

You could then download the final genesis file and start a node.
